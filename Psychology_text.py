AISS_text = '''1. Definition and Concept:
        
The concept of adjustment has originated from the term `adaptation`. It is the process where an individual cope, responds to their environment. The behavioural process by which humans and other animals maintain a state of equilibrium by various needs is called adjustment. It is subjective and it varies from culture to culture. A well adjusted individual in once culture might not be considered the same in another.

In the present test, adjustment is being measured by three different ways:
   Social – Man needs to be accepted by the society in which he lives. He has to follow norms of the society to be adjusted. He has to seek approval of the society and act accordingly.
   Emotional – An individual is emotionally adjusted if he/she is happy with themselves, realizes his/her potential and is content with what he/she has achieved.
   Educational – An educationally well-adjusted person is one who has an ability to think and innovate, he/she needs to be happy in their academic achievements.

2. History and description:
                
The AISS seeks to segregate well-adjusted school students [14-18 years] from poorly adjusted students in 3 areas – social, emotional, and educational. The test consists of 60 items where the subject is required to answer in terms of `yes` or `no`. each item in the test is scored as per the instructions given in the manual. The subject can be classified into five categories in accordance with the raw scores obtained by them in the inventory. The five categories are:
1.  A – Excellent
2.  B – Good
3.  C – Average
4.  D – Unsatisfactory
5.  E – Very Unsatisfactory'''

SCQ_text = '''
Self – It refers to totality of an individual`s conscious experiences, ideas, thoughts and feelings with regard to himself and herself.
The concept of self is created to help understand the personality theory better. 
                
How does self-develop – a newly born child has no idea of its self. As a child grows older, the idea of self emerges and its formation begins.
Parents, friends, teachers and significant others play a vital role in shaping a child`s ideas about self.
Our interactions with other people, our experiences and the meaning we give to them serve as the basis of our self.
The structure of self is modifiable in the light of our own experiences and the experiences we have of other people.
                
Self-concept – The way we perceive ourselves and the ideas we hold about our competencies and attributes is also called self-concept. 
This can be either positive or negative. A person may have a positive view of her/his athletics or bravery but a negative view of his academic talent. 
Studies indicate that by the age of 6-7 yrs. children seem to have formed self-concept at least in four areas:
                	Academics
                	Social Competence
                	Athletic competence
                	Physical appearance'
                
History and description
The SCQ was developed by Dr. R.K.Saraswat and it provides six separate dimensions of self-concept, namely:
                1.	physical [view about their body and health], 
                2.	social [sense of worth in social interactions], 
                3.	temperamental [emotional state], 
                4.	educational [in relation to school, teachers and co-curricular activities], 
                5.	moral [moral worth] and 
                6.	intellectual [ awareness of their intelligence and capacity to solve problems].'''

SCAT_text = '''
Basic Concepts: 
Anxiety is a vague, objectless fear or an uneasy feeling. It is an apprehensive feeling which is typically accompanied by a variety of psychological factors, including increase in heart rate, drying up of mouth, muscular tension and rapid breathing.

Three kinds of anxiety:

1.State anxiety – It describes the experience of unpleasant feelings when confronted with specific situations, demands or a particular object or event. It arises when the person makes a mental assessment of some type of threat. When the object or situation that is perceived as threatening goes away, the person no longer experiences anxiety. Thus, it’s a temporary condition in response to some perceived threat.
2.Trait Anxiety – It arises in response to a perceived threat but it differs in its intensity, duration and the range of situations in which it occurs. It refers to the difference between people in terms of their tendency to experience state anxiety in response to the anticipation of a threat. People with a high level of trait anxiety experience more intense degrees of state anxiety to specific situations than most people do not and experience anxiety toward a broader range of situations or objects than most people. 
3.Somatic anxiety– It is the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as butterflies in the stomach. It is commonly contrasted with cognitive anxiety, which is the mental.

Anxiety is observed to manifest itself in the following ways:
	Health
	Ambition
	Social relationships
	Future
	Family
